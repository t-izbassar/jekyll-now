title: Morning shift
---

Recently I decided to move my wake-up time to one hour earlier.
I moved it from 6:00-6:30 AM to 5:00-5:15 AM. I decided to
use this additional hour for myself. It turned out to be my
best decision in regards to personal productivity and here
I want to explain why.

## Routine

I have established and very defined morning routines that
I have been following for almost a year as of now. I wake
up, then I'm doing the morning workout after the bath, then
I take a shower and meditate for 15-20 minutes. After that
I going to work. I take breakfast either at work or
at home. So this whole routine takes the whole time if
I wake up at 6:00-6:30 AM. Sometimes I got a bit of time
to think through the day or read something, but it wasn't
consistent.

## The shift

The interesting thing happened when I decided to have
1 hour that belongs only to me in the morning. Having
such hour dedicated to myself is inspiring by itself.
And when you have something to desire (in my case it
was the desire to have this time) then you will arrange
everything around it.

As my desire is to have this hour it means that I don't
have to push myself to get up erlier. Because I know
if I stay longer in the bed then I am stealing the time
from myself so when in the morning I have a choise of
either to stay in bed a bit longer or get up and start
my day I now more easily getting up. It's reflected on
my waking up time which was 6:00-6:30 meaning that I
anticipating my wish to stay a bit longer in bed which
might take 30 minutes, but now this range is 15 minutes
long.

Also if I want to get up more earlier and with more ease
I need to go to bed earlier. Previously I didn't have
any positive motivation around that because if I go
to bed late then the next day I will feel bad and will
be unproductive. This motivation is based on negative
consequence rather than positive outcome. But now when
I have this hour it means that if I not go to bed in
time I will steal the time from myself again. But if
I will then I will gain this rewarding time. So going
to bed earlier now not only have negative motivation,
but also have positive one. I **want** to go to bed
earlier because I **want** to have my own hour.
