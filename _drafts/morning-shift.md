title: Morning shift
---

Recently I decided to move my wake-up time to one hour earlier.
I moved it from 6:00-6:30 AM to 5:00-5:15 AM. I decided to
use this additional hour for myself. It turned out to be the 
excellent decision in regards to personal productivity and here
I want to explain why.

## Routine

I have established morning routines that
I have been following for almost a year as of now. I am waking
up, then I'm doing the morning workout, then
I take the contrast shower and meditate for 15-20 minutes. 
This whole routine takes the entire morning time if
I wake up at 6:00-6:30 AM. Sometimes I got a bit of time
to think through the day or read something, but it isn't
consistent.

## The shift

The interesting thing happened when I decided to have
1 hour that belongs only to me in the morning. Having
such an hour dedicated to me is inspiring by itself.
And when you have something to desire (in my case it
was the desire to have this time) then you will arrange
everything around it.

As I desire to have this hour, it means that I don't
Have to push me to get up earlier. Because I know
if I stay longer in the bed, then I am stealing the time
from myself so when in the morning I have a choice of
either to stay in bed a bit longer or get up and start
My day I now more easily get up. It's reflected on
my wake up time which was 6:00-6:30 meaning that I
anticipating my wish to stay a bit longer in bed which
might take 30 minutes, but now this range is 15 minutes
long.

Also if I want to get up earlier and with more ease
I need to go to bed earlier. Previously I didn't have
any positive motivation around that because if I go
to bed late then the next day I will feel bad and will
be unproductive. This motivation is based on negative
consequence rather than a positive outcome. But now when
I have this hour it means that if I do not go to bed in
time, I will steal the time from myself again. But if
I will then I will gain this rewarding time. So going
to bed earlier now have not only the negative motivation 
but also have the positive one. I **want** to go to bed
earlier because I ** wish** to have my own hour.
