Father, software engineer, occasional and lazy blogger. Currently live in Krak√≥w, Poland.

### Intention

The intention of this blog is to host my personal thoughts, feelings, and opinions. I will write about various topics such as software development and management practices, recruiting, testing, living and more.

### Background

I was born in a village in Kazakhstan that is no longer exists. Somehow I've managed to sneak into physics and math oriented high school, that was gathering the talented students from the entire country. I've finished that school with the gold medal and later received the bachelor degree in applied math and computer science at Moscow State University.

I've started to work as a software developer in Moscow with C++ programming language during my study. When I finally received the diploma and returned to the homeland, I realized that there are no jobs for C++ developers in Kazakhstan. So I ended up learning Java, and it is stuck with me until now.
